## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alba, and I'm a Phd student in artificial intelligence based in Barcelona. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m studying how AI can make a social impact in policy-making. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving the pilot agent-based model (ABM) I built for policy-making purposes [AABM](https://github.com/albaaguilera/Aporophobia-ABM).
- ðŸ’¬ I'm integrating computer science tools (e.g. ABMs and reinforcement learning) with social science frameworks (e.g. the capability approach), check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01600).
