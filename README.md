## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alba, a Phd student in Artificial Intelligence based in Barcelona. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m studying how AI-driven simulations can inform policy-making. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my pilot agent-based model [AABM](https://github.com/albaaguilera/Aporophobia-ABM).
- ðŸ’¬ I'm integrating computer science (e.g. agent-based modelling and reinforcement learning) with social science frameworks (e.g. the capability approach)
  - Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18389).
